# learn-coding

Hi, I am new to coding and am trying to learn it without any prior knowledge.

I am using Code Academy as my learning platform and would like to share some projects on the platform.
The project I will be posting would already be re-checked by looking at the official solution provided but I would like some feedbacks on any of my original code.

For now, I would like to share my projects on two different programming language, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Note: Each language will be specified on its corresponding repository title.
